## Will A.I. set you free?

My Answer is "A.I. will not set you free!"
You don't need to know about A.I. to understand this conclusion.
You can see how the future is going by looking at what has been done with "technology" so far.

> Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we have the ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the Web. It would understand exactly <ins>what you wanted</ins>, and it would give you the right thing.
<cite>by Larry Page<span class="footnote">https://achievement.org/achiever/larry-page/#interview</span></cite>

This is a statement by Google founder Larry Page in an interview in 2000.
As of 2024, he still thinks roughly the same way, and they have been working toward exactly this statement.
Will they set you free?

To explain it, let's start by looking at the uproar that occurred at OpenAI, Inc.

## Uproar at OpenAI, Inc.
AI is currently being developed by many companies, but the actual status of private companies is not known in detail.
OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, has a different background than other companies, and there was an uproar that gave us a glimpse into the inner workings of the company.

OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization (NPO) while the founders recognized the risks of A.I.<span class="footnote">Now a for-profit company.</span>
Their idea was that they would lead the development of A.I. and that they would use their power *fairly*.
OpenAI says its mission is "to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits <ins>all of humanity</ins>."

In November 2023, OpenAI's board of directors suddenly made the decision to remove CEO Sam Altman.
Five days after his removal, Altman was reinstated and at the same time several members of the board were ousted.
At this time, one of the board members who left OpenAI, Helen Toner, a researcher specializing in A.I. risk, had accused OpenAI of a disregard for risk four days before Altman's dismissal.<span class="footnote">Decoding Intensions - Artificial Intelligenceand Costly Signals
https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Decoding-Intentions.pdf
</span>  
This event clearly shows that the priority was placed on winning the competition, even if it meant putting A.I. at risk.
but I would like to point out that <ins>even before that</ins> their A.I. risk perception neglects the current issues.

OpenAI published a document called the System Card, which summarizes the risks of A.I. in 12 categories.<span class="footnote">
2024.3.4 GPT-4 Technical Report Appendix H GPT-4 System Card
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774</span>
The tenth section, “Economic Impact,” begins with the following sentence:
> The impact of GPT-4 on the economy and workforce should be a crucial consideration for policymakers and other stakeholders.
After clearly stating that this is not their area of responsibility, the sentence that follows is also a statement to the limited extent of “be careful with the changes”. There is no in-depth content there.  
Furthermore, I would like to point out that the system card does <ins>not at all</ins> address the reality of the enormous amount of power consumed by computer use.
The huge amount of electricity being used for A.I. is now being criticized as a reality.

Economic and environmental issues are major concerns today, and they have been brought about by the development of technology.
A.I. is a further advancement of existing technology and its impact is even greater.
We cannot expect OpenAI to address these issues given their attitude to presenting risk.
Why can't even risk experts face up to the risks when they are so obvious and so current?

Here are my thoughts:

A person can be a director of OpenAI because he/she does not see reality, and a person who properly faces reality cannot be a director of OpenAI.
{{% /definition %}}

In other words, OpenAI's philosophy has been flimsy before, and it has reached a situation where even such a philosophy is unacceptable as it is swept away by market forces.  
I would like to explain this issue using the word *everyone*.

## *everyone*
The word "everyone" can be used in two ways: one that <ins>includes</ins> oneself and one that <ins>excludes</ins> oneself. In this document, we will focus only on the former, where <ins>*everyone* includes oneself</ins>.

*Everyone* does not mean “all people” or “all of humanity”.
For example, *everyone* benefits from technology, but not all people benefit from it.
Some of *everyone* benefit greatly, while others receive negligible benefits in comparison, or are rather oppressed.

People act *fairly and responsibly* in *common sense* with regard to *everyone*.

### Nobody controls *everyone*
There are positions prepared according to *everyone*'s wants, and the person who behaves as asked for is placed in that position.

OpenAI, for example, is not controlled by CEO Sam Altman.
He is in that position behaving the way *everyone* wants him to behave.
If Sam Altman behaved himself in a way that *everyone* didn't want, then a company other than OpenAI would be leading the industry.

The behavior that *everyone* wants changes as circumstances dictate.
Helen Toner was a <ins>just right</ins> risk expert for *everyone* when she took over, but she had to step down because the behavior *everyone* wanted changed as competition increased.

### *Responsible* jobs for *everyone*
Google has grown a lot by successfully <ins>responding to what *everyone* wants</ins>.
This is the *responsible* work of Google employees.
On the other hand, Google <ins>responded to what *everyone* wants</ins>, resulting in a filter bubble, a fractured society, and a distorted reality that suits them in their respective bubbles.  
If any Google employee is concerned about this reality and tries to resist this trend, he or she will be cold-shouldered and displaced internally<span class="footnote">I've seen and heard such information several times, but I can't remember the source.</span>.
Consequently, those who can identify with *everyone* will be selected, and they will see a distorted reality in their bubble that is convenient for them.
By this mechanism, they can continue to work as a *fair and responsible* job in *common sense* for *everyone*.

## in the end
Technology is catering to the desires of *everyone*.
One of the consequences has been the destruction of the environment by enabling the consumption of vast amounts of energy.
Also, the system has grown so large that it has created a sense of individual powerlessness.
The more one conforms to *everyone*, the more one benefits.
The more one's *self** differs from *everyone*, the more one is disadvantaged by economic rationality and other pressures.
The more convenient and widely rooted technology becomes in life, the more its gravitational pull of rationality increases 
and the more obvious the structure of the **center** and **periphery** becomes.

The more technology caters to *everyone's* desires, the more it prevents you from being free.
Technology is a tool, and how it brings benefits and losses is a matter of the ability of those who use it.
Today, mankind is not mastering technology, but rather being dominated by it.
We need to recognize this reality and break free from it.
Since we cannot even master current technology, it is clear that even more powerful technology, A.I., will amplify the threat.  
For you to be free to use A.I., the individual must control the technology.
On a societal level, that means you need autonomy.

Technology is seen as a good thing because it serves *everyone*'s desires, and this causes all sorts of problems.
In other words, these problems are caused by *everyone*'s *common sense and fair* routine.
Finding the *villains* to blame based on distorted *common sense* and then kicking them out will not solve anything.  
The solution to the problem will be achieved by rewriting our common sense<span class="footnote">This is not a font style mistake. It is not a matter of following common sense, but rather the current *common sense* is wrong.</span>.
Living against the existing *common sense* means independence from the **center**, but independence in pieces will be exhausted by the imposition of irrationality.
It is necessary to develop a place where various independent people on the **periphery** can connect with each other in solidarity.
There are diverse stories, each with its own reasons for being on the **periphery** despite the imposition of irrationality.
I feel that Larry Page's opening statement lacks imagination for what is outside his field of vision.
Everything on the Web is not enough to fully understand what you want.
No one knows what you “really” want in the first place, and it is not something you can figure out alone.
It is what you find in the chaos created by a diverse and rich society that includes many uncertainties.  
For a more detailed discussion, including about the chaos, please refer to the “Nama Intelligence - Will A.I. set you free?”( https://mzo.kuku9.net/namachi/en ).
The document explains how current A.I. works, presents the similarities and differences between it and human intelligence, and then discusses its social impact.
